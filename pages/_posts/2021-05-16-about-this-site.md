I think I starting learning about Jekyll in early 2020. I had come across Tom Preston-Werner's origin story: [Blogging Like a Hacker](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) and decided I also wanted to 'blog like a hacker'. My interest in mainstream social media sites was fading but I needed a place to put my thoughts and pictures. It was important to me that my blog would be free of costs and that anyone, even non-hackers, would be able to fork and use their own versions. It is for these reasons that I landed on the combination of services used and listed below. Every component is free to access and a configured, browser-based CMS is included for those who don't code. I consciously chose to interface with these companies not because I support them, but because these are the tools I found that are available for the job. My hope is to inspire further divestment from the corporate network. This is version 1.0. 

Becca's Inventory was built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and was written using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The files are stored in a GitHub repository which you can fork [here](https://github.com/beccasinventory/live). I am using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) as a free user to compile and deploy the repository, and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is installed to access and edit my content from a browser. My only overhead cost is my custom domain, which I purchased from [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/) for $8.58 a year.

Resources:\
• [Setup your Mac for development, 2020 edition](https://dev.to/v3frankie/setup-your-mac-for-development-2020-edition-1c8a) (slightly out of date, but a good introduction for beginners to get their basic code environment installed)\
• [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)\
• [Create a Multi Blog Site with Jekyll](https://www.garron.me/en/blog/multi-blog-site-jekyll.html) (I am following this model of creating multiple feeds based on a structure of category folders)\
• [Jekyll::Paginate V2](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2/) (because I'm using multiple feeds, my system is dependent on this plugin)\
• [Installing Netlify CMS for Jekyll](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/jekyll/)\
• [Netlify CMS Widgets Documentation](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/widgets)\
• [](https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996#multiple-ssh-keys-settings-for-different-github-account)[Multiple SSH Keys for Different GitHub Accounts](https://gist.github.com/jexchan/2351996) (not essential, but I created a new GitHub account to store only this repository and so this article helped me figure out how to automatically authenticate into multiple accounts on a per-project level)

This project wouldn't be possible without help from my friends. I am grateful to Ian G. for first introducing me to Netlify and the concept of a free website, j9 for so much but especially helping me overcome my fear of command line, fanfare for chat support and talking through ideas, Natalia P. for a fruitful conversation in April 2020, Will K. for agreeing to be my guinea pig, and Gordon F. and Elizaveta S. for their encouragement during the final steps of coding.

Becca's Inventory is dedicated to KDX.

Launch: May 16, 2021
